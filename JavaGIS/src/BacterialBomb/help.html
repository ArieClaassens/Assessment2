            <div class="content">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The BADdm application is used to create a raster data file of the fallout from a biological weapon
                    detonated in the middle of a town on top of a building. BADdm models the fallout of the bacterial agents 
                    using two calculations to determine the change in height and direction for each particle every second.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The height calculation decrements the height of the particle by 1 meter for every second if the 
                    particle is equal to or below the original detonation point's height.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The directional change is calculated using a random number generator, with the resulting number assigned to 
                    one of four predefined direction brackets, with the range of the brackets correlating to the proportional 
                    probability for change. The change probabilities are defined at 5% West, 10% North, 10% South and 75% West, 
                    but may be modified via the Direction change probabilities sliders provided on the right-hand of 
                    the application interface.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h2>Processing a raster file</h2>               
                <p>This is the primary function of the application. The process consists of loading the raster data 
                    source file, modying the modeller parameters if required, running the model and then saving the 
                    calculated dispersal pattern in a new raster output file. The steps are covered in greater detail below.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>1. Load the raster data file</h3>
                <p>Click on the menu bar, select the File menu item and then click on the Open File menu sub-item, or 
                    alternatively use the Ctrl+O keyboard combination. Select your raster data source file using the 
                    file dialog window that is now open. Click on the Open button to load the data source file into the 
                    BADdm application. To return to the main application window without selecting a file, click on the Cancel button.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>You will notice that the application disables the Save Raster File and Save Random Raster File menu sub-items 
                    until the application has generated the output raster data files.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>2. Process the raster data file</h3>
                <p>BADdm loads a set of default parameters for the model execution, i.e. the directional change probabilities, 
                    detonation height, detonation point and number of particles. You may change these parameters using the 
                    Direction change probabilities sliders on the right-hand side of the application interface, the 
                    detonation point coordinate value text fields at the bottom of the application interface and the detonation 
                    height (Start height), along with the number of bacterial particles to include in your calculation.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The direction change probabilities sliders can be moved by mouse or keyboard and must provide a cumulative 
                    total of 100%, as shown in the bottom slider titled TOTAL %, before the application will allow the model 
                    to be run.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The detonation point coodinates, start height and particle count values can be set by typing the 
                    required values directly into the respective text field, or in the case of the X Position and Y 
                    Position fields, by clicking on the required location in the window pane directly above these text fields. 
                    As the mouse moves around in the window pane, the cursor changes to a cross-hair, while the Mouse X Pos 
                    and Y Pos values update in real-time to indicate the relative position of the mouse cursor, in order to 
                    provide greater accuracy in selecting the new detonation point.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Once you are happy with the values of the parameters, click on the Run modeller button located underneath 
                    the Direction change probabilities sliders. If the application detects incorrect parameters, it will 
                    display a warning message in the message box located underneath of the Run Modeller button. Correct the 
                    error and then click the Run Modeller button again to launch the model execution. The File menu contains 
                    a Run Modeller menu item, which can also be used to launch the modeller execution, either by clicking on 
                    the File menu and then clicking on the Run Modeller sub-menu item, or by using the keyboard shortcut Ctl+R.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>3. Save the results raster data file</h3>
                <p>Click on the File menu and then click on the Save Raster File menu sub-item, or alternatively use the 
                    Ctrl+S keyboard combination. In the File Save dialog window that has opened, type in a name for the 
                    output raster data set, or click on an existing file in the file listing window to overwrite an existing file. 
                    Click on the Save button to save the new file or overwrite the existing raster file. To return to the 
                    main application window without saving the raster output to a file, click on the Cancel button.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <h2>Generating random data</h2>
                <p>The random data generation component sets a random detonation point that falls within the boundaries of 
                    the dispersal analysis area. This is accomplished by deducting the detonation height from the width and 
                    height of the analysis area in order to keep the dispersal area inside the analysis area by assuming a 
                    worst case scenario of 100% probability of continued dispersal in a single direction, e.g. all particles 
                    are dispersed in an Eastern direction at the maximum rate of descent. This would have the particles all 
                    land in one spot, the distance of the detonation height away from the detonation point, i.e. 75m East of 
                    the detonation point for a detonation height of 75m. The steps required to generate a random dispersal 
                    raster data set are as follows:</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>1. Generate the random dispersal data</h3>
                Click on the Edit menu and then click on the Generate Random Data menu sub-item, or alternatively, use 
                the Ctrl+D keyboard combination.
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>2. Save the random results raster data file</h3>
                <p>Click on the File menu and then click on the Save Random Raster File menu sub-item, or alternatively use the 
                    Ctrl+T keyboard combination. In the File Save dialog window that has opened, type in a name for the 
                    output raster data set, or click on an existing file in the file listing window to overwrite an existing file. 
                    Click on the Save button to save the new file or overwrite the existing raster file. To return to the 
                    main application window without saving the random raster output to a file, click on the Cancel button.</p>
                <p>You will notice that the application disables the Save Raster File and Save Random Raster File menu sub-items 
                    until the application has generated the output raster data files.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h2>Changing Model parameters</h2>
                <p>The BADdm application allows you to the change the parameters used in the model. Changes may be made to 
                the direction change probabilities to influence the directional changes particles undergo, the detonation 
                point may be changed to find the detonation point required to cover a specific area, while the detonation 
                point height may be adjusted to study the affect of detonation at various heights above ground level. The 
                final parameter change available is the number of particles that are included in the model, providing a 
                way to determine the change in dispersal patterns for varying sizes of bacterial or viral delivery devices.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>1. Changing the Direction change probabilities</h3>
                <p>The direction change probabilities sliders can be moved by mouse or keyboard and must provide a 
                    cumulative total of 100%, as shown in the bottom slider titled TOTAL %, before the application will 
                    allow the model to be run. To change the change probability for a specific direction, click on its 
                corresponding slider and drag the slider button to the left or right in order to adjust the probability 
                value. Alternatively, after you have clicked on the slider button, use the left and right arrows on your 
                keyboard to adjust the slider button. With every change to the direction change probability sliders, the 
                application calculates the total direction change probability, which must provide a total of 100%. If 
                the combined values of the four direction change probability sliders do not equal to 100%, the last 
                slider, which represents the total direction change probability, changes its text color to red in order to 
                provide a visual clue to the discrepancy. For your convenience, we also provided a text field below the 
                total direction change probability slider, which displays the precise total direction change probability. 
                This will allow you to gauge the required change to implement to one or more of the direction change 
                probability sliders in order to bring the total probability back to a value of 100%.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>2. Changing the Detonation point</h3>
                <p>The detonation point coordinates can be set by clicking on the dispersal map pane or entering the X 
                    and Y positions in the respective X Position and Y Position text fields. The Mouse X Pos and Mouse 
                    Y Pos text fields display the relative position of the cursor in the dispersal map pane, irrespective 
                    of the presence of any maps, and should be used to aid in identifying the general location of potential 
                    detonation points. Once you have decided on a suitable detonation point, click the mouse button to select 
                    the current mouse cursor position as the new detonation point. You may then use the X Position and Y 
                    Position text fields to make adjustments to the X and Y positions, or skip the mouse cursor-based 
                    selection process and supply the required coordinate values directly to these text fields.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>3. Changing the Detonation (Start) height</h3>
                <p>Click in the text field to the right of the Start height (m) label at the bottom letf of the application. 
                    Type in the detonation height, in number of meters, to use in the modelling process, e.g. 10 or 50 
                    or 200. Do not use any number formatting such as commas, plus or minus symbols, or partial values 
                    such as 50.2, or text values such as "fifty".</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>4. Changing the Particle Count</h3>
                <p>Click in the text field to the right of the Particle count label at the bottom of the application. 
                    Type in the number of whole particles to use in the modelling process, e.g. 100 or 5000 or 10000. 
                    Do not use any number formatting such as commas, plus or minus symbols, or partial values such as 500.2, 
                    or text values such as "one hundred".</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
